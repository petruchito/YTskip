# YTskip
YTskip adds hotkeys on YouTube to seek by 1 second. I was missing this functionality while adding new segments to [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)

## Usage
- Install a userscript manager
(This script is written and tested with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/))
- Open [YTskip.user.js](https://github.com/petruchito/YTskip/raw/main/YTskip.user.js)
- Click `Install`
- Use <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>,</KBD> and <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>.</KBD> keys to seek by 1 second.
